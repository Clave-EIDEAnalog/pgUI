## Tutorial_II. Text panels.

# Currently being in preparation!

## 3.- Insert a text panel.
In the last tutotral you've learned to insert texts in the pygame window and how to modify them so that the texts show how your game skills progress. By using those *infoTexts* and having a bit of patience you may get something like this:

which shows a complete set of information on the matter.
To do it by using the tools described in the last paragraph is a bit clumsy: you have to calculate widths and heights of texts so that they appear perfectly aligned into columns.

pgUI has a class *textPanel* which takes charge of locating things so that you can forget about it: you just tell pgUI which texts -fixed: left column; variable: right column- you want to form the panel, the position, size ando colors to use and *voil√°*, pgUI organizes it all so that you can forget about it.
