# pgUI
Small GUI for pygame.

## Motivation
This repository is for a small GUI to be used along with pygame (graphics python library). 

Python is a great programming language, and pygame an excellent library to -graphically- show whatever you want. While primarily intended for games, it has revealed as a general purpose graphics library. At EIDE foundation is widely used for app's having graphical output.

Pygame has no interface tools -in a way it is an interface itself. But app's developped on pygame sometimes need one or two buttons to change something. Sometimes they need to show a statistic or a text column ... May be even games sometimes need a button.

pgUI is a pygame 'sub-library' that gives the user the possibility of adding functional buttons and simple texts (both fixed or dynamic -game/app dependant) to your pygame app.
